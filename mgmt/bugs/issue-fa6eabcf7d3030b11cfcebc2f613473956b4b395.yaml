title: clean up Behavior decorators
desc: |-
  extremely messy right now. maybe enforce better naming conventions
  auto-doc the decorators for use in the BTree / graphical Behavior editor
  this may have to happen later.
  we should enforce that all behaviors be checked for validity before even trying to execute them (esp ones that have side-effects)
