- new unit for campaign views: spy / infiltrator (enemy spy)
  can sabotage the ranks of your army
  out them with a "purge" mini game -- reading their behaviors / interrogation

-- is a contextual action the same as a contextual menu? hell no
    - menu --> multiple options, delayed response
    - action --> 1 action, immediate response
    - contextual action must be very VERY well designed
    - who says you can't have both?
        - contextual actions for some, menus for others
    - can bind specific actions to a context action (e.g. zelda: A = sword, B = hook)

-- content game...
    - made as a vehicle (really) for content that's produced from a direction
    - a story is a content
    - content is critical, but look at how you are pacing and using it

-- on PERMADEATH: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rec.games.roguelike.development/9leesIK3ijg
Permadeath: Whether it's good for your game or not depends on how
quickly it happens, how long the game is, how quickly you can restart
(do you have to pick a new race, class, name, weapon) and especially
how varied a start can you give the player? Many games fail at this.
Is the first level lava caves? Dwarven gold caves? Limestone caverns
eroded? The kings dungeon? The Goblin King's Dungeon? If each game is
short and starts out interesting it's okay to fail over and over
because each game is so very different and fun. Modern games don't do
this though. They want their characters to live and they want hard
work to be done easily. They create many hours of content meant to
just be 'gotten through.' Everyone can get through, it's prospering
that is hard.
