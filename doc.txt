_ Microarmy ____________________________________________________________________

  Team wins if a unit reaches the opposing team's edge.
  
  todo: Team wins if resources are depleted / cannot deploy reinforcements /
        all units and structures are destroyed.
  todo: Mission objective based win / lose conditions.

  todo: Move all entity behaviors into behavior tree.

_ Gameplay _____________________________________________________________________

  Control outcome of battle by planning + deploying weapons.
  Supply of troops usually capped. You don't purchase / manufacture any units
  during a battle, instead you transfer them from a supply.
  In addition, you get to salvage weaponry / equipment after a battle.
  
  Units can gain experience. Structures can be hardened / add functionality.
  (upgrade / downgrade -- to get resources and funding for other stuff, when 
  you need to build bases / fortify bases)
  
  Vehicles/personnel are secondary currencies in non-battle view.
  
  In the campaign map, you can choose locations for building a base.
  You control a military. Indirectly control the units as well.
  
  MAIN ORDER, location of main order and the units will figure out how to
  accomplish the order on their own -- emergent.
  
  More a management game than a twitch game.
  
  Should have pluggable properties (more so than now) and abilities so you can
  create a unit that is a combination.
  

  Defeat opposing force / survive timed mission / complete objective(s).
  Campaign features needed later... allows for multiplayer.

_ Structures ___________________________________________________________________


CommCenter
  contains PistolInfantry and RocketInfantry supply
  panic attack when severely damaged
  explodes when destroyed

Barracks
  contains PistolInfantry supply
  explodes when destroyed
  
Pillbox
  crew capacity of 8, reload time decreases with capacity
  small repairs made when crew supply is replenished
  fires bursts of MGBullets
  can be occupied by enemy forces if unmanned

Small Turret
  automated heavy sentry with cannon weapon
  cannot be commandeered by enemy troops
  high resistance to small arms fire
  effective against vehicles

Scaffold
  construction site for structure to be built
  can be occupied by enemy troops who may complete the construction
    -- resulting in ownership of the finished structure
  highly vulnerable to damage, any damage to the scaffold risks worker death

RepairYard
  repairs 2 ground vehicles at once to 80% - 90% of mint condition
  vehicles cannot attach while under repair
  once repair has finished, vehicles have a rearming delay before activating  

Depot
  vehicle deployment site

Helipad
  helicopter refueling site


_ Infantry _____________________________________________________________________

Pistol Infantry
  currency unit of the battlefield
  cheap but in effective en mass
  weak unit but advances with courage
  
Rocket Infantry
  fires a fragmentation rocket that deals high damage
  effective against tight troop formations and buildings
  able to see enemies from twice the distance of other infantry

Engineer Infantry
  very weak
  builds new structures by laying down a scaffold
  construction site is occupied by PistolInfantry
    each structure has to be occupied by a required number of PistolInfantry
    before it can be fully constructed
