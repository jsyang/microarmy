How do we want to introduce gameplay elements to the player in a way that avoids a "tutorial" level or written instructions that they are forced to read? See some examples: Megaman X, conveyance of player actions and dynamics with the environment. Put the player in a situation that gradually introduces and forces them to use certain elements to progress through the intro.  
- shadow player (stronger than the player, but parallel so player can see his near-future trajectory)
- can't give everything away, save some key elements to be discovered independently  
doesn't need to be a fundamental thing, could just be more weapons or caches that player can take advantage of

Key gameplay element is that the environment is proactive on its own, but the player can alter its course with 
their actions. Essential element of the gameplay is that no special abilities are hidden from the player at any level. The only impediment for doing things is resources, if the player has skill, he should be allowed to do all the things a more supplied player could do with the exception of resource-based things. (no artificial restrictions)

Determine outcome of  
- **battle** by planning and deploying weapons  
- **war** by winning strategic battles

Supply of troops usually capped. You don't purchase / manufacture any units during a battle, instead you transfer them from a supply, or reinforce from a location with existing troops. In addition, you get to salvage weaponry / equipment after a battle.

Units can gain experience. Structures can be hardened / add functionality. (upgrade / downgrade -- to get resources and funding for other stuff, when you need to build bases / fortify bases)

Vehicles/personnel are secondary currencies in campaign view. In the campaign map, you can choose locations for building a base. You control a military. Cannot possibly hope to micromanage all the units, so we won't focus on unit level control. More management than tactical twitching.
 
MAIN ORDER, location of main order and the units will figure out how to accomplish the order on their own.
Units/bases should have pluggable properties (more than just behavior trees) and abilities so you can create a unit that is a combination of various attributes. Especially good if some of these are inadvertent and earned through battle/other mechanisms for "promotion".

Defeat opposing force / survive timed mission / complete objective(s). Campaign features needed later... allows for multiplayer.

### Enhancements to Battleview Gameplay

- more structure based / special tactic pieces: in the style of mines, where effective use is planning rather than rushing with a larger quantity of units
- mechanics for active defense against homing / tracked projectiles:
  - projectile is destroyed.
  - RETURN-TO-SENDER: projectile is hijacked, redirected to attack the team it was fired from
- physical barriers or walls to passively limit extent of enemy controlled territory
  - engineers with sapper abilities to cheaply defeat these barriers (would take more time and firepower to destroy otherwise)
- deformable terrain: if large structure's foundation damaged too much, it collapses (can be salvaged, but not rebuilt)
- fog of war through special pockets of terrain / dense buildings:
  - can't see exactly what's in it unless you have a unit inside
  - cover advantage destroyed when this terrain feature is destroyed only possible with heavy weapons
  - units can choose to hide in it to "man" it like a pillbox

### Campaign view stuff

- for campaign view, column units move with flocking AI? such level of complexity is probably not necessary, but would be nice to have

- weapons cache locations -- able to supply/upgrade units with resources from these locations if the location is captured intact

- negotiate with enemy commanders to get them to turn on their teams / ally temporarily for mutual benefit

- hex tiles for initiating battleview combat. armies can attack up to 3 hexes away. (this limits the amount of terrain that needs to be generated / saved (for network server)
