## Old stuff -- rewrite stuff in this section

## Structures

### CommCenter
* can supply all Infantry types
* panic attack when severely damaged
* explodes when destroyed
* battle is lost when CommCenter is destroyed

### Comm Relay
* receives signals from HQ

### Missile Rack
* requires signal from CommRelay or CommCenter to attack targets
* fires HomingMissile
* weak, explodes when destroyed

### Barracks
* contains PistolInfantry supply
* explodes when destroyed
  
### Pillbox
* crew capacity of 8, reload time decreases with capacity
* small repairs made when crew supply is replenished
* fires bursts of MGBullets
* can be occupied by enemy forces if unmanned

### Small Turret
* automated heavy sentry with cannon weapon
* cannot be commandeered by enemy troops
* high resistance to small arms fire
* effective against vehicles

### Scaffold
* construction site for structure to be built
* can be occupied by enemy troops who may complete the construction
  * resulting in ownership of the finished structure
* highly vulnerable to damage, any damage to the scaffold risks worker death

### RepairYard
* repairs 2 ground vehicles at once to 80% - 90% of mint condition
* vehicles cannot attach while under repair
* once repair has finished, vehicles have a rearming delay before activating  

### Depot
* vehicle deployment site -- contains a supply of vehicles: on-site inventory
* does not manufacture vehicles

### Helipad
* helicopter refueling site
* does not manufacture helicopters

## Infantry

### Pistol Infantry
* currency unit of the battlefield
* cheap but in effective en mass
* weak unit but advances with rabid courage
  
### Rocket Infantry
* fires a fragmentation rocket that deals high damage
* effective against tight troop formations and buildings
* able to see enemies from twice the distance of other infantry

### Engineer Infantry
* very weak
* builds new structures by laying down a Scaffold
* construction site is occupied by PistolInfantry
  * each structure has to be occupied by a required number of PistolInfantry before it can be fully  constructed
