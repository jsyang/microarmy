title: implement squad-level behavior
desc: |-
  Commanders poll them and send them orders, squad level figures out raw unit level tactics
  squad has an- on near-death / death behavior as well -- squad members might retreat or join nearby squads
  if morale is too low, squad members disband and the individual AI takes over
  if too many members die in squad, morale decreases immensely
  once disbanded, the individuals use self Behaviors or a chance of "panicked" Behaviors
