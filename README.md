## Ditz is a *Command-line Issue Tracker*
Checkout the *issues* orphan branch and run `ditz` to see issues.  
Run `ditz html` to build a web snapshot of the issues.

For support Google `ditz issue tracker` or search Github for lingering repos, since the project seems to have been
abandoned by the original author!
