Infantry                                        | Description
------------------------------------------------|------------
Pistol Infantry <br> [1][1]                     | Pistol, no bodyarmor. Currency unit of the battlefield, effective en mass. Advances with rabid courage. Joe everyman; he is the foundation of armies.
Rocket Infantry <br> [2][2]                     | Fires a fragmentation rocket that deals high damage. Deadly against tight troop formations and buildings. Can see enemies from twice the distance of other infantry.
Engineer Infantry <br> [3][3]                   | Low resistance to attack. Builds new structures by laying down a scaffold, resulting construction site is crewed by Pistol Infantry. The target structure is fully constructed once the scaffold has been fully crewed.
**Structure** |     
Small Scaffold <br> [4][4]                      | Framework for constructing fortifications, is capturable. Highly vulnerable to damage. Any damage to the scaffold risks crew death.
Small Land Mine <br> [5][5]                     | Pressure sensitive anti-personnel mine. Moderate damage. Excels at maiming in all occasions.
Pillbox <br>[6][6]                              | Light machine gun, crew of 4. Capturable strong point. Made in China.
Small Turret <br>[7][7]                         | 30mm HEAT auto-loading cannon. Medium range, medium armor. "Reach out and touch someone."
Small Missile Launcher <br>[8][8]               | Rapid-fire medium-range heat seeking missile.
Small Ammo Dump <br>[9][9]                      | Small missile supplies. Highly explosive. Dislikes smokers.
Surface-to-Surface Missile Launcher<br>[10][10] | Requires command signal to engage targets. Autonomous extreme-range cruise missile. Severe damage, do not point at face.
Ammo Dump <br>[11][11]                          | Various missile supplies. Popular at birthday parties and corporate events.
Guard Tower <br>[12][12]                        | Medium range IR / laser scope; sights targets for support weapons. A valuable tool for any commander.
Communications Relay <br>[13][13]               | Shortwave radio / satellite communication relay. TX/RX encrypted strategic orders. Battle control may be lost if relay is destroyed. It is the field commander's connection to HQ.
Communications Bunker <br>[14][14]              | Tactical planning center; crewed with infantry. Heavy armor; kinda looks like a turtle.
Barracks <br>[15][15]                           | Container for light infantry groups large and small.
Vehicle Depot <br>[16][16]                      | Contains a supply of vehicles: on-site inventory. Does not manufacture vehicles.
