- define core gameplay
- create randomized battles in battle view
    -- parametrized battles, not random
- smooth out terrain generation
    -- assign parameters for coarseness of terrain (should be able to restrict to regions of the map)
- create game music
    -- different tracks for different events and states of progress
    -- music reactive to game events
- enforce rule: all Behavior.Custom decorators need to check for the ability to perform the action before attempting
- create bomber aircraft units
- create foliage and special structures
- battle/peakGenerator generates cliffs
    -- handle cliffs properly or smooth out battle terrain
- create squad level behaviors
    -- morale, if too low, squad members disband and their individual AI takes over
    -- while in squad, squad members use squad member AI
    -- if outside of squad, ex-members use own AI; panicked AI or normal AI

            ---- behavior to see what to do if vehicle cannot advance
                ----- stop and hold
                ----- reverse
                ----- radio commander for transport heli
                ----- radio commander to level terrain

        --- mg nest instead of pillbox  (2 x crew)
        --- mortar nest                 (2 x crew, functions immediately)
        --- one way barrier             (friendlies move unrestricted, enemies running into it must destroy it first)
        --- logistics tent              (makes reloading of missiles / encampments faster, heals infantry)
        --- observation post            (enlarges range of commander attention in immediate area; sets rally points for squads, picks better targets for missile launchers)
        --- jamming station             ()
    -- new aircraft
        --- transport heli              (3 x medium storage)
        --- light attack heli           (4 x smallrocket)

        --- spaceplane                  (2 x large storage / 2 x bunker buster)
        --- small ufo craft             (1 x medium storage, long range, high speed, low fuel capacity)
    -- booby trapped buildings          (if occupied by enemy forces, it has a special effect? blows up, reveals some intel to the rigger?)
    -- hideout structures
        - bunker
        - cave
        - urban bunker -- fortified high rise
            -- level 1, 2, 3 functions as separate mini-battles, only infantry can participate
            -- OR level the whole thing
                --- morale effects
                --- loss of loot, intel, etc

        - temperate woods
        - underground bunker (cave entrance)
        - desert oasis

- interface notes (todo)
- huge tank plot line?
    -- breaks into pieces that must be destroyed individually
    -- pieces individually attack separate bases
    -- basically a mobile base (mother craft)

- story options
    -- STARTING GOOD: defeat the evil empire (like jagged alliance)
